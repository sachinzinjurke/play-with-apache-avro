Playing with apache avro
Projetc demonstrates two ways of serializing/deserializing avro schemas using avro tools.

1. Use avro maven plugin to generate classes automatically for you. See the POM file for the different plugins and depedencies used for this.
2. Use the avro Schema parser to generate the data using avro schema file definition
